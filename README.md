# # Claude Sonnet 4 — Full Master README (LDB.AI)

## Overview

This README explains the **complete system build and deployment process** for the **Liga de Boxeo (LDB.AI)** website powered by **Claude Sonnet 4**. It ensures consistency across design, development, health verification, continuous integration (CI), preview, and production promotion.

The purpose is to enable Claude Sonnet 4 (via VS Code + GitHub integration) to fully execute the build — from generating production-grade code to verifying the deployment health and promoting the final output to production.

## ⚙️ Build Workflow

### 1. **Initial Project Setup**

* Clone repository and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  git clone <repo-url>
  cd ldb-ai
  npm install
  ```
* Run local development server:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  The app will be available at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

### 2. **Claude Sonnet 4 Build Execution**

Claude Sonnet 4 executes full build instructions directly from the `MASTER_PROMPT_CLAUDE_SONNET_4.txt` file.
It handles:

* Full Next.js + Tailwind configuration
* Component rendering (Hero, AI widgets, Brand, etc.)
* Style composition (dark gradient backgrounds, typography, responsiveness)
* CI/CD and health test scaffolding

> Claude Sonnet 4 should never use placeholders — all content must be real, final assets.

## 🧠 Hero Section Structure

The hero layout represents the front-facing entry of the LDB.AI site.

* **Top Section:** Logo + slogan + CTA buttons
* **AI Widget Bar:** AI-driven search and data interface
* **Visual:** Wallpaper background (dark gold hue aligned with LDB brand)

Ensure:

* No blocking ropes or unnecessary foregrounds.
* Dark tones match logo gold (#DAA520) and background blacks (#000, #0A0A0A).
* Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile).

---

## 🩺 Health Verification

Health endpoints ensure deployment integrity.

### `/api/health`

Returns JSON response verifying uptime, response time, and status code.

### `/api/health/badge`

Generates dynamic badge for CI workflow.

Example response:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": "99.99%",
  "response_time": "58ms"
}
```

---

## 🔄 Continuous Integration (CI)

GitHub Actions automate verification and deployment.

### `health-check.yml`

* Runs on pull requests and commits to `main` or `dev`
* Checks build + lint + unit tests
* Pings `/api/health` to verify service health
* Blocks promotion if any check fails

### `preview.yml`

* Builds and deploys to Vercel preview environment
* Adds environment badge and commit reference

### `production.yml`

* Promotes verified build from preview → production after passing all checks
* Tags release with build ID and timestamp

---

## 🚀 Deployment Process

1. Commit changes to `dev` branch.
2. CI runs `health-check.yml`.
3. On success, `preview.yml` triggers a Vercel preview deployment.
4. Once verified, merge into `main`.
5. `production.yml` promotes deployment to live domain.

---

## 🧩 Asset Management

* **Logos:** `/public/brand/logo.png` (transparent background preferred)
* **Wallpaper:** `/public/wallpaper.jpg` (dark gradient, boxing ring perspective)
* **Favicon:** Auto-generated by Vercel from logo.png

Ensure file naming and format consistency before running Claude builds.

---

## 🧠 Developer Notes

* Do **not** use placeholders for assets or text.
* All hero components must use actual brand data.
* Maintain responsive layout using Tailwind’s grid/flex utilities.
* Keep background effects subtle and brand-aligned.
* All AI widgets are to be real and functional (no mockups).

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

✅ Code builds without error on `npm run build`
✅ Health endpoint returns 200 and `status: healthy`
✅ CI badge displays success
✅ Preview deploy verified on Vercel
✅ Production domain updated

## 🧭 Final Notes

This README, alongside the **MASTER PROMPT**, serves as the canonical guide for rebuilding and deploying the full LDB.AI site via Claude Sonnet 4.

Claude must follow each instruction **sequentially**, without summarization, without question, and without placeholder substitution.

> **Command:** Execute full build → verify health → run CI → preview deploy → promote to production.
